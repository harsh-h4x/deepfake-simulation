# Architecture and Tools for Deepfake Video and Voice Phishing Attack Simulation

## Overview
This document outlines the architecture, tools, and workflow for simulating a deepfake-based phishing attack. The simulation demonstrates how attackers can impersonate trusted individuals using AI-generated video and voice, and how users can be trained to detect and respond to such attacks.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Deepfake Video Generation
- Tool: DeepFaceLab, Synthesia, HeyGen, or similar.
- Input: Source video of the target individual (e.g., CEO).
- Output: AI-generated video with manipulated facial expressions and lip-sync to match the phishing script.
- Notes: Use publicly available or consented videos for training.

### 2. Voice Cloning
- Tool: ElevenLabs, Resemble AI, or similar voice cloning APIs.
- Input: Audio samples of the target voice.
- Output: AI-generated voice message matching the phishing script.
- Notes: Ensure ethical use and permissions.

### 3. Video and Audio Compositing
- Tool: Video editing software (e.g., Adobe Premiere, DaVinci Resolve) or programmatic compositing.
- Purpose: Combine deepfake video and cloned voice into a seamless phishing video.

### 4. Interactive Prototype
- Platform: Web app (React, Vue, or plain JS) or Python Flask app.
- Features:
  - Play phishing video or voice message.
  - Simulate user interaction (e.g., input fields for responses).
  - Show verification steps and countermeasures.
- Purpose: Demonstrate attack flow and teach verification methods.

## Attack Flow Simulation
1. Attacker generates deepfake video and voice message impersonating an executive.
2. Phishing message is delivered to the target user (simulated in prototype).
3. User is prompted to respond or take action (e.g., approve wire transfer).
4. Prototype shows potential consequences of falling for the attack.
5. Verification and countermeasure steps are demonstrated (e.g., call back, digital watermark check).

## Security and Ethical Considerations
- Use only consented or synthetic data.
- Clearly label demos as simulations.
- Educate users on recognizing deepfake phishing attacks.

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time deepfake generation.
- Integration with phishing email simulation platforms.
- Advanced user behavior analytics.
